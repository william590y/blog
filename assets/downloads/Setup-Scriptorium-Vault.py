#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Sets up Scriptorium in any Obsidian vault: a vault you already write in, a new vault Obsidian has just made, or a
# folder of notes that has never been opened in Obsidian. Windows, macOS and Linux; needs Python 3.8 or later, and
# nothing else.
#
#   python3 Setup-Scriptorium-Vault.py /path/to/vault            shows what it would change, and asks before doing it
#   python3 Setup-Scriptorium-Vault.py /path/to/vault --dry-run  only shows what it would change
#   python3 Setup-Scriptorium-Vault.py /path/to/vault --yes      does it without asking
#   ... --package <Scriptorium.zip or a vault folder>            takes Scriptorium from there instead of downloading it
#
# What it does, and does not do (Scriptorium Setup on Windows follows the same rules: "Set up Scriptorium in this
# vault"; so does the command "Scriptorium: Set up another vault" inside Obsidian):
#   - It never touches a note or any file outside the vault's .obsidian folder, and it deletes nothing.
#   - Scriptorium's own files are written into .obsidian: the manuscript snippet, the Typewriter theme, and the
#     Scriptorium, Lagrange, Manuscriptum and Typewriter Mode plugins. A file of that name that differs is replaced.
#   - Your settings are merged, not overwritten: your community plugins stay on and Scriptorium's are added to the
#     list; your snippets stay on and "manuscript" is added; the theme becomes Typewriter; Scriptorium's text size is
#     set only if you have not chosen one (in app.json, or in appearance.json, where Obsidian now keeps it). A plugin's own settings (data.json) are written only if it has none. Your
#     hotkeys, workspace and every other setting are left alone.
#   - Before anything is changed, the whole .obsidian folder as it was is copied to
#     .obsidian/scriptorium-backup-<date>-<time>/.obsidian. If anything fails half-way, every file is put back.
#   - Run again, it changes nothing (and makes no second backup).
# Close the vault in Obsidian first: Obsidian rewrites some of these files while the vault is open. Afterwards open
# the vault and, when Obsidian asks, choose "Trust author and enable plugins".
#
# Without --package it uses the vault/ folder of a Scriptorium checkout if this file is in one, and otherwise
# downloads Scriptorium.zip from williamliaw.com and checks its SHA-256 against the one pinned below.
